The system should support creation of contexts
- The system should not force users to create and work within contexts (default context?)
- Information artifacts (bookmarks and histories) should be constrained to the context
- The user should be able to annotate contexts
- Annotation should support rich media/other applications/files
- The user should be able to specify to-do lists based on contexts (task management)
- The system should be able to show all tabs (thumbnail/overview/tiling) of a ocntext simultaneously.

The system should support splitting and merging of contexts (child/parent tasks)
- The user should be able to drag a tab to a separate window to create a new context
- The user should be able to extract an entire context to a separate window

The system should support switching between contexts
- Notifications of changes in active contexts not in focus (i.e. bubble notification, bouncing names in the toolbar)
- The user can have multiple active contexts and default context at the same time(in the same window?)
- The user should be able to hide away a context for later retrieval
- The user should be able to transfer artifacts between contexts
- Each context should be shown in a different icon/tab in the task bar.


The system should support storing of contexts (as a single link? hibernation?)
- The user should be able to add/access a context to/from the quick toolbar?
- The user should be able to only open selected artifacts in a context.

The system should support sharing of contexts
- The user should be able to share an entire context with other people or themselves (using one single link? file?)
- The user should be able to filter the contexts when sharing. (i.e. remove annotations)

The system should support deleting of contexts
- The user should be able to mark something as finish on a to-do list
