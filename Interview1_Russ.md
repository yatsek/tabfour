Raw Visit Report

Participant is an 18 year old hairdressing student living in Seattle. Not a heavy computer user, she does much of her browsing on her cellphone with unlimited data plan. She checks email and goes on Facebook several times a day on her phone, and only uses a PC every couple of days, for longer browsing sessions (several hours). She mostly views content on the phone, but inputs on the computer since it is much easier to type. For example, she reads Facebook messages she receives daily on the phone, but only replies every few days. Sometimes she will go on the computer for a specific information seeking task like looking up an address or phone number.

Not really sure what the browser on the phone is, and the phone has "computer mode" and "phone mode"; not really sure of the significance but it doesn't seem promising.
At home uses Firefox, because IE is slower.

Often uses YouTube, "looking at dumb videos", that is, aimlessly browsing for funny stuff. Also, looks for music on YouTube. Sometimes while looking for music it's just aimless browsing, but sometimes its a directed search. For example, while listening to the radio in the car she'll hear a song she likes and she'll jot down some lyrics in the "Notes" function of phone. Later, she'll search this on YouTube on the PC at home.

To go to these commonly visited sites, she points the cursor at the address bar then types in the address, i.e. "youtube.com" (no "http://www."). She never uses bookmarks or the bookmarks toolbar, since she isn't using her own computer: either uses her sister's or the family computer. If she's typing an address and it appears in the dropdown menu (drops down from the AwesomeBar), she'll point at it with the mouse if that's easier than continuing to type. If she's almost done, she'll just continue (muscle memory of finishing the commonly typed address is strong). Doesn't use the down arrow to select items in the drop down list.

She has tried to send links to people before but has often had trouble. For example, tried to paste into hotmail. Not sure why it didn't work, but I suspect it may have split across lines. Typically she will just give up and instruct the recipient on how to find the item manually: "Type in <> in youtube, then there's a picture of <>".

Other than Hotmail, Facebook, Google, and Youtube, rarely re-visit pages. Typically finds it easier just to search for a page than remember where it is.

To open a new tab, she uses the mouse and clicks File->New Tab. If, in the course of browsing, a new window is opened when she clicks a link, she will just continue working in the new window without caring very much. However, sometimes this is annoying as something may have been "left behind", such as when cross referencing an address on a website with Google Maps, she'll have to reopen Google Maps in the new window. At the end of her browsing session she closes everything, so the system is clean for other people to use. Typically she doesn't feel a need to close windows or tabs early (before the end of the browsing session).

Sometimes she'll use Word at the same time as the browser. Recently (previous week) was working on resume in Word, and reading websites with tips and advice on making resumes in browser. To switch between the windows she uses the mouse and clicks on the Windows taskbar.

In the course of browsing, she doesn't intentionally open up many tabs or windows at once. She only left clicks on links, and does not use advanced features like ctrl-click to open in new tab, right-click->open in new window, or similar. She just clicks a link, reads what is there, and when finished uses the back button.

Important information gets written down on paper and put in her purse. This is more permanent, belongs specifically to her (whereas computer is shared), and can be taken with her (like in the car, or to a friend's house). Sometimes she'll write the information into the Notes function of her phone, if it's handier.

Recently planned a hairdressing course. Friend had suggested two possibilities, one in Vancouver and one in Los Angeles. She needed to figure out which courses were offered, prices, timing (i.e. course dates), long distance transportation, accomodation, and local transportation. Criteria for hotels were price, quality, and location. Was the hotel in walking distance, was there good transit to the location of the academy, or would they need a car (and have to pay for parking)? She looked up flight+hotel packages on Expedia.com, then sorted the results (hotels) by price. She'd scan the list and find one which "wasn't too sketchy" based on the picture and "star" ratings. Then she would click on it and read the details, then copy the name and search for it in Google Maps in order to figure out how close it was to the academy. Then she'd go back and try the next promising candidate. When she was done she wrote the info on a piece of paper to show to her friend. She only looked at each hotel once, and just stopped when she found one that was good enough.
