Participant is 25 year old male CPSC grad student. Heavy computer user, uses a browser for several hours per day. Identified research tasks for school to be a key instance of heavy browser usage: looking up papers on Google Scholar and watching TED talks are two key elements of this. Sometimes he looks up specific papers which have been referred to him by someone or assigned in a class, and sometimes just browsing a topic area.

Throughout the day the browser stays open, and email is always open. In particular, GMail is left open in the browser, while Hotmail notifies of incoming messages through (Windows Live) Messenger. GMail changes title of page when new message comes in.

Course webpages are visited frequently, especially when a dealine is approaching. He has only two items in the bookmarks toolbar, both of them for course webpages. He reports having the identical set of bookmarks on his home computer as on his laptop. No bookmarks exist in the sidebar on either computer. Reports being "minimalistic" when it comes to using tools to support browsing.

Main browser is Google Chrome. First page shown when launching the browser is 8 most frequently used pages. Reports frequent usage of these pages, kind of like "automatic bookmarking". This page is also shown in new tabs.

When he is starting some task such as researching something, he opens up new window and will open many new tabs in rapid succession.

How would he track the academic papers he has found? On his home computer, he would just minimize that window and leave it open for a while: sometimes more than a week. Only needs to "clean up" and close things if it is slowing down the system. Doesn't do anything particular to track a paper, instead just searches for it later when he needs it again. Sometimes if he really thinks he'll need it he copies the address into an email and sends it to himself (assume this is so it will be available from across computers).

Does use history sometimes. In particular, visits some sites which have Chinese characters in the name. The Chinese characters are annoying to input, so it is easier to find the site in the history. Doesn't do anything special to sort the history, just uses the default "sort by date".

Searches in the address bar (works well in Chrome). If needs to share a link, he'll send over IM. Typically uses only 8-10 tabs; might try and close some if there are more than this.
